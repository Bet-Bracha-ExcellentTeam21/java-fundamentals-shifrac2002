Improve your TDD skill implementing Binary Search Tree

### Task
**Binary Search Tree (BST)** is an ordered (sorted) data structure. Your job is to implement the interface `BinarySearchTree`
 by practicing TDD discipline
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to know **The Three laws of TDD**:
1. You should not write production code until you have written a failing unit test
2. You should not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail
3. You should not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the failing test 
   
Also refresh your knowledege about [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree).
and [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)).

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing `BinarySearchTree` interface following *three laws of TDD*
* If you don't have enough knowladge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout branch **completed** and see the final implementation
