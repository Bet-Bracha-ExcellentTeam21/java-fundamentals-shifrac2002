### Task
**Binary Search Tree (BST)** is an ordered (sorted) data structure. You job is to implement the interface `BinarySearchTree`
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to know about [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree).
 Knowledge about [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) also may be helpful.

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing `BinarySearchTree` interface
* Unit test are already prepared for you - use them to check your implementation
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout branch **completed** and see the final implementation
