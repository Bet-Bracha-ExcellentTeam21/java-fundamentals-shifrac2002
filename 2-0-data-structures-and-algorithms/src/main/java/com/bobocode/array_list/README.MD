Improve your basic knowledge about data structures and Java Core by implementing ArrayList from scratch.  
### Task
`List<T>` interface provides an API with a couple of typical methods. Your job is to implement the *todo* section of 
`ArrayList<T>` class. To verify your implementation, run `ArrayListTest.java`.
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with arrays, cycles, conditions, exceptions and variables.

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
